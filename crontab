# Edit this file to introduce tasks to be run by cron.

# Each task to run has to be defined through a single line indicating with different fields when the task will be run and what command
# to run for the task
#
# To define the time you can provide concrete values for minute (m), hour (h), day of month (dom), month (mon), and day of week (dow)
# or use '*' in these fields (for 'any').
#
# Notice that tasks will be started based on the cron's system
# daemon's notion of time and timezones.
#
# Output of the crontab jobs (including errors) is sent through
# email to the user the crontab file belongs to (unless redirected).
#
# For example, you can run a backup of all your user accounts
# at 5 a.m every week with:
# 0 5 * * 1 tar -zcf /var/backups/home.tgz /home/
#
# For more information see the manual pages of crontab(5) and cron(8)
#
# Wikimedia Toolforge specific note:
#   Please be aware that *only* jsub and jstart are acceptable
#   commands to schedule via cron.  Any command specified here will
#   be modified to be invoked through jsub unless it is one of
#   the two.
#


# Everything migrated to k8s, see jobs.yml instead for list of jobs
